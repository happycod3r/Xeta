# Xeta v1.0.0

# About

Xeta is an open-source OMZ inspired framework for managing your zsh configuration. Includes all themes from oh-my-zsh, an expanded cli and much more. Unlike oh-my-zsh though most of the core plugins such as zsh-synta-highlighting, zsh-auto-suggestions, zsh-history-substring-search and others are integrated and built into xeta as default components rather than as plugins. I just thought "Why wouldn't I want those things by default?" 
I kind of got tired of managing multiple things at once like omz, p10k etc. to get the terminal experience that I want so I decided to assimilate everything into one "frankenstein" framework and so Xeta-framework & the Xeta-cli were born.

### Reporting a vulnerability or bug?

**Do not submit an issue or pull request**: A general rule of thumb is to never publicly report bugs or vulnerabilities because you might inadvertently reveal it to unethical people who may use it for bad. Instead, you can email me directly at: [paulmccarthy676@gmail.com](mailto:paulmccarthy676@gmail.com). I will deal with the issue privately and submit a patch as soon as possible.
